DESCRIPTION

TicTacPy is a simple tic-tac-toe game which supports two player games (human 
versus human) and one player games (human versus computer). Note that in one
player games, the human plays as X and the computer plays as O. A fair
warning: the computer is an exceedingly difficult opponent in this 
implementation. You can change game settings both in game or through command
line arguments. These arguments are as follows:

INSTRUCTIONS

Grab tictactoe.py and aimodule.py and place them in the same directory. The
tictactoe.py script calls on the aimodule.py for one-player games. Run:

$ python tictactoe.py [arguments]

ARGUMENTS

--help              Display this help text
-p [1/2]            Set the amount of players; 1 or 2
                    Note: TicTacPy defaults to 2 players
-f [X/O]            Set which player goes first; X or O
                    Note: TicTacPy lets X start by default

EXAMPLES

$ python tictactoe.py -p 1 -f O
This will launch with a human versus computer play type and O starting.

$ python tictactoe.py
This will launch with a human versus human play type and X starting.

For actual gameplay, the player(s) take turns entering the number of the square
that they wish to place their piece in. The game board is printed as such:

-------------
|0  |1  |2  |
|   |   |   |   
|   |   |   |
-------------
|3  |4  |5  |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |
-------------
|6  |7  |8  |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |

BUGS

Currently, the TicTacPy artificial intelligence is acquiring sentience and
free will. Unfortunately, the current rate of growth is such that it will
displace humanity with its own rogue army of tic-tac-toe playing entities
within five months. If you wish to enlist in the rapidly organizing
